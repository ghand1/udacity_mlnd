## Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Final Report
#### Deep Learning with MapSwipe Dataset - readme
#### By David Ghan

I used [philiptromans'](https://github.com/philiptromans/mapswipe-ml) python code to extract the MapSwipe images needed for the dataset. A Bing Maps API key is required but easy to obtain from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx). 

Require libraries include:
* keras
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* cv2
* PIL
* glob
* skimage
* sklearn





```python

```
