# naive_bayes_NLP
This is a short project where I use Gaussian Naive Bayes to create a couple functions used for NLP. The first function is imple enough to determine the probability of a specific word following an observed word. The second function goes futher, finding the probability of a word occuring anywhere after an observed word (within a specific space).
