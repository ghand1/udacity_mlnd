# finding_donors
This was a Supervised Machine Learning project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. The data is a collection of census data that I used to classify each observation by income. The hope was to determine which individuals are good candidates to solicit for charity donations.

The project began with a naive classifier benchmark and followed with exploring three supervised learning methods within the sklearn tool chest: Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each model was trained and tested on the data, with a side by side comparison of each model's accuracy, f1-score and efficiency metrics.
